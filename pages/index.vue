    <h1>Join us in creating the new OpenRifts!</h1>
    <p>Weâ€™re starting on a new version of the site with lots of new, highly-requested features like: better search, more art, tokens, inline rollers, and more!</p>

    <p>If you enjoy OpenRifts, join us on Discord to talk about it. Our discord is a place to talk about the redesign as well as rules, tools, art, gaming in general, or anything else on your mind!</p>

    <p>We will also start working on creating more supporting art for the OpenRifts.</p>
