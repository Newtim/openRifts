# After first level

As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she
gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who
reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This
advancement is called **gaining a level**.

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants
additional features, as detailed in the class description. 

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1d6 to your Hit Points. Roll 1d6 add the total to
your hit point maximum. 

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in
levels from level 1 through level 15. Consult the information in your character's
class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.
