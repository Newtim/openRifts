# Background

## Alignment
All players must choose an alignment for their character. This defines a character's attitudes and provides a moral center. There are three basic alignment categories: Good, Selfish and Evil. 
Alignments play a vital role in developing a character's personality and are a key element of "role" playing. Whether we are consciously 139 aware of it or not, every person has his or her own moral compass to guide him. Whether one calls it a code of ethics and morals, or justice and honor, or religious values, alignments define what the character sees as right and wrong, good and evil, acceptable behavior and what is not acceptable. It is this sense of right and wrong that helps build moral fiber, mold one's behavior, and dictate how a character treats others and how he should react when faced with a moral choice.
Alignments should be a guideline for each character that indicates how he or she is likely to react to any given situation. Try to have your character stay true to his alignment and act accordingly, even if it goes against the grain. In fact, battling to stay true to one's alignment replicates the conscience and realistic moral dilemmas, i.e., being emotionally torn to do the right thing, or what feels good at the moment. An act of cruelty out of revenge or hate, for example, might sound good in the heat of the moment, but is not the good or right thing to do. A player struggling with such a decision for his character emulates that emotional gut process. 
When a player finds himself slipping (or slipped) out of character, the Game Master (G.M.) should stop the game for a moment and, as the referee/director of the story, point out that the player's intended actions go against his alignment. The G.M. should then warn that moving for-ward with that choice may cause the character to change alignment. For example: A Principled good character that acts out of hatred and deliberately tortures another being is likely to drop to the Anarchist or even Miscreant evil alignment depending on how cruel and vicious the act was, or how much the character enjoyed it. Similarly, a Principled character who decides to steal or "bend" the law is likely to drop to a Scrupulous or Unprincipled alignment, and to Anarchist if he keeps stealing or breaking the law. Everyone makes a mistake from time to time, but repeated drops from alignment and/or no remorse for a wrongdoing will cause a quick change. Likewise, a Miscreant evil character who has learned the value of friendship and begins to act kind, noble and compassionate, or forsakes his villainous ways, may go up to Anarchist or Unprincipled, and eventually, even higher if he keeps it up. However, achieving a better, higher moral alignment should be much, much more difficult to achieve than the quick plummet into a bad or self-serving alignment.
Playing in character (e.g., in alignment) can be a challenge, but it is always fun and worth doing. 
###No Neutral Alignments 
There is no such thing as an absolute neutral alignment. A character with an absolute, true neutral position could not make a decision, fight tyranny, hurt others, go adventuring, or take any action of any kind without leaning toward good, evil, or self-gratification. It is humanly impossible, and therefore is eliminated in the context of this game. There are some philosophers out there who might disagree with this, but that's a topic for another forum and not a factor of this game. Sorry, this is one of the very few definitive, unbending rules. 
###Good Alignments 
Good aligned characters (Principled and Scrupulous) are the straight-up heroes of this world. They generally place a high value on life and liberty, as well as law and order. Just because a character is of a good alignment, however, does not mean he's a saint or without bad habits. Good characters can be irritating, obnoxious and arrogant, even prejudiced and full of annoying quirks. Likewise, they may find them-selves stepping outside the boundaries of the law in their quest to com-bat evil and injustice, but when push comes to shove, these characters can always be trusted to do the right thing, especially in a life and death situation. 
####Principled (Good) 
Principled characters are upright "boy scout" or "do-gooder" types who put others before themselves. This is the knight in shining armor, with the highest regard for the lives and well-being of others, freedom, truth, honor and justice. Principled characters will always attempt to work with and within the law, and have a high regard for (and trust of) authority, as well as for life and freedom. They are usually compassion-ate, merciful, cooperative and sincere. 
#####A Principled character will ... 
1. Always keep his word. 
2. 	Avoid lies. 
3. 	Never kill or attack an unarmed foe. 
4. 	Never harm an innocent. 
5. 	Never torture for any reason. 
6. 	Never kill for pleasure. 
7. 	Always help others. 
8. 	Always work within the law whenever possible. 
9. 	Never break the law unless conditions are desperate. This means no breaking and entering, theft, torture, unprovoked assaults, etc. 
10. 	Respect authority, law, self-discipline and honor. 
11. 	Work well in a group. 
12. 	Never take "dirty" money, or ill-gotten valuables or goods. This means any property that belongs to criminals or villains. It matters not how the bad guys got that property themselves; the hero will not touch it even if destitute. 
13. 	Never betray a friend.

####Scrupulous (Good)
Scrupulous characters value life and freedom above all else and despise those who would deprive others of them. This type of hero is typically portrayed in many movies as the cop who plays by his own rules, forced to work beyond the law for justice (or retribution) and the greater good of the people. They are not vicious or vindictive characters, but are individuals driven by their sense of justice to right a wrong or take a (bloody) stand. These characters will always attempt to work with or within the law whenever possible. 
#####A Scrupulous character will ... 
1. Keep his word to any other good person.
2. Lie only to people of selfish or evil alignments.
3. Never attack or kill an unarmed foe.
4. Never harm an innocent.
5. Never torture for pleasure, but may use muscle to extract information from criminals or evil characters.
6. Never kill for pleasure, will always attempt to bring the villain to justice alive, no matter how vile he may find him.
7. Always try to help others.
8. Attempt to work within the law whenever possible.
9. Bend and, occasionally, break the law when deemed necessary. This means he may use strong-arm techniques, harass, break and enter, steal, and so on (but only against the bad guys).
10. Distrust authority; fears the law and government may not be an effective weapon against injustice and crime. However, he will try not to flagrantly disregard the law. II. Work with groups, but dislike confining laws and bureaucracy (red tape).
11. Never take "dirty" money or items.
12. Never betray a friend.

### Selfish Alignments
Selfish characters (Unprincipled and Anarchist) are not necessarily evil, but they always have their own best interests at heart and their opinions in mind above all others. These are the mercenaries, rogues, vigilantes and anti-heroes of the world.
####Unprincipled (Selfish) 
This basically good person tends to be selfish, greedy, and holds his personal freedom and welfare above almost everything else. He dislikes confining laws and self-discipline and distrusts authority. He views the law and government as well intentioned, but clumsy and ineffective. Keeping his best interests in mind, the character will always look out for himself. This character is also likely to take "dirty" money and items, with the concept that it will help him in his crusade against evil. He may also destroy the property of known criminals. He will not deal in illegal wares, drugs, or take money from innocent or good people. The Un-principled character may associate with both good and evil characters, and often has paid informants, spies and stoolies. This is the noble scoundrel, the guy who is always looking for the best deal, associates with good and evil characters, is continually tempted to lie and cheat, and hates himself for being loyal, helping others and ultimately doing the "right thing." An 
#####Unprincipled character will ...
1. Keep his word of honor.
2. Lie and cheat if necessary (especially to those of Anarchist and evil alignments).
3. Not kill an unarmed foe (but will take advantage of one).
4. Never harm an innocent.
5. Not use torture unless absolutely necessary.
6. Never kill for pleasure; will attempt to bring the villain to justice alive and ruin him rather than simply kill him.
7. Usually help those in need.
8. Rarely attempt to work within the law.
9. Blatantly break the law to achieve his (usually good-intentioned) goals.
10. Dislike and distrust authority, the law and bureaucracy. Feels they have been corrupted and abused.
11. Work with groups, especially if it serves his needs, is profitable, and/or he is in the limelight.
12. Take "dirty" money.
13. Never betray a friend.
14. Have a high regard for life and freedom. 

####Anarchist (Selfish)
This type of character likes to indulge himself in everything. He is the insurgent, con-artist, gambler and uncommitted freebooter who adventures because he enjoys the thrill, fame and fortune it brings, rather than for any cause (like defending humanity). This character will at least consider doing anything if the price is right or the challenge is al-luring enough. Laws and rules infringe on personal freedom and were meant to be broken. He will not hesitate at using strong-arm techniques, breaking and entering, theft, harassment, destruction of private property, and so on. This can also include acting as judge, jury, and executioner. These characters are usually the daring anti-heroes who feel the end justifies the means. The Anarchist-aligned person is always looking for the best deal and self-gratification. He will work with good, selfish and evil characters to attain his goals. The Anarchist is continually teetering be-tween good and evil, rebelling against and bending the law to fit his needs. Mercenaries and thieves often fall into this category. 
#####An Anarchist character will ... 
1. Keep his word, but only if it suits or pleases him.
2. Lie and cheat if he feels it necessary.
3. Not be likely to kill an unarmed foe, but certainly will knock out, attack or beat up one.
4. Never kill an innocent, although his rash or self-serving actions may injure or kill bystanders by accident.
5. Use torture to extract information, but is not likely to do so for pleasure.
6. Seldom kill for pleasure.
7. Not be likely to help someone without some ulterior motive (even if it's only to show off).
8. Rarely work within the law unless it serves his purpose.
9. Constantly break the law to achieve his goals.
10. Have little respect for authority, the law, or self-discipline.
11. Not work well within groups; tends to do as he pleases, despite orders to the contrary.
12. Take "dirty" money without hesitation.
13. Possibly betray a friend. Sorry, pal. 

###Evil Alignments 
All evil characters (Aberrant, Miscreant and Diabolic) are not necessarily bent on universal genocide or dominating all other living creatures. Nor are all evil characters sadistic, cruel, ugly or untrustworthy. Many evil characters may actually seem kind or likeable. Evil alignments are a step beyond the self-gratification of the selfish alignments. Evil characters are ruthless individuals who are willing to say or do anything to achieve their goals. Most commonly, evil characters have goals that either entail making people suffer or cause suffering as a side effect (a side effect the evil character knowingly and callously disregards). Human life has little meaning to them, and friends tend to be (but not always) people to use and discard when they are no longer of value. Evil aligned characters do not automatically slay any good-aligned person because of different ethics and philosophy. All the better to use good to achieve their own goals, for the end always justifies the means. Note: There is nothing wrong with playing a fictional, evil character, although he may not survive too long if he betrays or harms too many people, nor is the character likely to be trusted or liked by his "good" teammates. However, this is role-playing, not reality, so you can play any type of character you might desire, just continue to play "in character". That having been said, player characters in BTS-2 tend to be-or strive to be-brave, noble and heroic. 
####Aberrant (Evil)
The cliche that there is "no honor among thieves" is false when dealing with the Aberrant character. This is an individual who is driven to attain his goals though force, power, and intimidation. Yet the Aber-rant character stands apart from the norm with his own personal (and twisted) code of ethics. He expects loyalty from his minions, punishing disloyalty and treachery with a swift, merciful death or banishment. An Aberrant character will always keep his word of honor and uphold any bargains. He will define his terms and live by them, whether anyone else likes them or not. If an anti-hero, he will completely disregard the law and deal out justice as he deems fit. He will never be cruel or vindictive, and will al-ways be absolutely positive that the person is guilty before he deals out his brand of justice. However, once he condemns a character, he will see to it that he is destroyed.
Whether a  villain or a  corrupt or extreme anti-hero, the Aberrant character looks upon people without honor or a  sense of loyalty as worthless and disgusting lowlifes. Do not think of the Aberrant character as a misguided good guy. He or she will break all laws with impunity, harass victims, destroy prop-erty, assault, blackmail, torture and murder. Only their methods and de-gree of violence may vary. 
#####An Aberrant character will ...
1. Always keep his word of honor (at least to those he deems worthy of it).
2. Lie and cheat to those not worthy of his respect; good, selfish or evil.
3. May or may not kill an unarmed foe.
4. Never kill an innocent, particularly a  child, but may harm, harass or kidnap.
5. Never torture for pleasure, but will use it to extract information and intimidate others.
6. Never kill for pleasure, will always have a reason.
7. May or may not help someone in need.
8. Rarely attempt to work within the Jaw.
9. Break the law without hesitation.
10. Have no use for the law or bureaucracy, but respects honor, self-discipline and the "concept" oflaws and order.
11. Work with others to attain his goals.
12. Usually take "dirty" money, although his twisted code of ethics may prevent him from doing so in some instances.
13. Never betray a friend. Never.

####Miscreant (Evil) 
This self-serving, unscrupulous character is out only for himself. Power, glory, wealth, position, and anything that will make his life more comfortable or pleasurable is his goal. It doesn't matter who gets caught in the middle, as long as he comes out smelling like a rose. The character will lie, cheat, hurt, and kill anyone to attain his personal goals. If a  Miscreant character becomes a  vigilante, mercenary, or bounty hunter, it will be for some personal reason, a  vendetta, money, glory or a  love for danger and challenge. This character is a savage misanthrope out for himself.
#####A Miscreant character will ...
1. Not necessarily keep his word to anyone.
2. Lie and cheat indiscriminately (good, evil, selfish).
3. Kill an unarmed foe as readily as he would a  potential threat or competition.
4. Use or harm an innocent.
5. Use torture for extracting information and pleasure.
6. May kill for sheer pleasure.
7. Feel no compulsion to help without some sort of tangible reward for him.
8. Have no deference to the law, but will work within the law if he must.
9. Blatantly break the law for his own goals and pleasure.
10. Dislike and distrust authority and the law.
11. Work with others if it will help him attain his personal goals.
12. Take "dirty" money, stolen goods, and illegal items (as well as steal valuables for himself whenever the opportunity arises).
13. Betray a friend if it serves his needs.
14. Have no respect or concern for the lives or welfare of others.

####Diabolic (Evil) 
This is the category that most megalomaniacs, psychopaths, and vi-olent and despicable characters fall into. This is the cruel, brutal killer who trusts no one and has no value for any life other than his own. A Diabolic character will crush anyone who gets in his way. The lowlife will lie, cheat, con, abuse and kill anyone less powerful than he is. Ab-errant characters find these dishonorable people more revolting than a good aligned character. 
#####A Diabolic character will ...
1. Rarely keep his word, and has no honor.
2. Lie to and cheat anyone.
3. Most certainly attack and kill an unarmed foe.
4. Hurt and kill an innocent without a  second thought and for pleasure.
5. Use torture for pleasure and information, regularly.
6. Kill for sheer pleasure.
7. Be likely to help someone only on a  whim (or to set them up for some evil deed later).
8. Rarely attempt to work within the law.
9. Blatantly break the law and mock authority.
10. Despise honor, authority and self-discipline. Views them as weaknesses.
11. Not work well within a  group; constantly disregarding orders and vying for power/command.
12. Always take "dirty" money, drugs, stolen goods, etc., as well as steal from others.
13. Betray a friend without hesitation; after all, you can always find new friends.
14. Associate mostly with other evil alignments.



## Languages

Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default,
and your background might give you access to one or more additional
languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one
that is common in your campaign. With your GM's permission, you can
instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret
language, such as thieves' cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many
dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran,
Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental
planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can
communicate with one another.

## Inspiration

Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing
your character in a way that's true to his or her personality traits,
ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your
personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge
in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call
on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect
of a spell that has been laid on you.

### Gaining Inspiration

Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons.
Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give
in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray
your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can
earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don't---you can't stockpile multiple
"inspirations" for later use.

### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll,
saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you
advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for
good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in
the game. When another player character does something that really
contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up
your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

## Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where
you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the
world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled
soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue
might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a
jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your
character's identity. The most important question to ask about your
background is *what changed*? Why did you stop doing whatever your
background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money
to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy
background, why don't you have *more* money? How did you learn the
skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share
your background?

The sample background presented here provides both concrete benefits
(features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

### Proficiencies

Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described
in "Using Ability Scores").

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or
more tools (detailed in "`srd:equipment`").

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different
sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind
(skill or tool) instead.

### Languages

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages
beyond those given by race. See `srd:languages`."

### Equipment

Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the
optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting
equipment from your background.

### Suggested Characteristics

A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your
background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them
randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of
your own creation.

### Customizing a Background

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it
better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a
background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any
two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages
from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package
from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment
section. (If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package
suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one
ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches
your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

**Looking for more Backgrounds?**

Only one background was included in the [5e
SRD](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf). We
are hoping to expand using homebrew or third-party content.

If you know of high-quality content that would be a good fit, please
[contact us](mailto:gm@5esrd.com) or [submit it on
github](https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e).

### Acolyte

You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or
pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the
holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering
sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the
divine. You are not necessarily a cleric---performing sacred rites is
not the same thing as channeling divine power.

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from
among those listed in "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" or those specified
by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious
service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high
priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different
way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any
established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a
fiendish master that you now deny.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion

**Languages:** Two of your choice

**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the
priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense,
vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp

### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful

As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith,
and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your
adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a
temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you
must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share
your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen
deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the
temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or
a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you
can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you
ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your
temple.

### Suggested Characteristics

Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious
communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and
their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their
mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or
heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.
